## Edit in Vim

Do you love Nylas N1 email client? No? It's okay because now you're gonna: instead of the default boring editor, you will be using Vim to edit your emails! Yes, Vim with the same .vimrc that you put lots of love and effort into. Don't thank me! Or do if you like the plugin. Whatever! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Installation is easy:
```
$ cd ~/.nylas/dev/packages
$ git clone https://github.com/last5bits/nylas-vim-edit.git vim-edit
```

Please note that this plugin depends on "temp". So. Go into `~/.nylas/dev/packages/vim-edit` and execute the following:
```
$ npm install temp
```
